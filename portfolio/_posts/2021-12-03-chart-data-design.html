<h2>The case:</h2>

<p>When modernizing this legacy chart, my team and I realized we couldn't simply upgrade it to our current design system. It wasn't a part of our library of chart tech, and we <strong>needed a more clear way to show comparative data that relied on more</strong> than our system chart colors.</p>

<h2>The role:</h2>

<p>As the visual designer, I worked to create a solution that both solved for <strong>showing all the data required at the same time</strong>; and a way to <strong>keep the many elements from competing</strong>
   for user attention. This involved collaborating with the data engineers to be sure we both honored the integrity of the data, and translated it for folks who are not mathematically-focused.</p>

<h2>The solve:</h2>

<p>The way we solved for competing data was to <strong>employ the use of differing shapes, tints, and line textures to increase accessibility</strong>. We focused the <strong>primary data</strong> with one saturated color, and the <strong>comparative data</strong> with shades of grey. To help distinguish the greys, we employed white space to create bands in our stacked bars. This, in addition to opacity shifts, <strong>helped our users understand which data visual to look at first, and compare it</strong>.</p>
