        These charts are <strong>data visualizations</strong> that are the output of a new functionality to the users of a market analysis app, full of complex data and hypotheticals — and that needed to be made into a much more <strong>simple and easy-to-use tool, while still honoring the complexity and granularity of the program</strong>. The result was way to conduct economic Scenario Analysis.

      This also meant creating the result of a ran program — the charts shown here — that helped show a difference between historical data and fictional hypotheticals; as well as the difference between what a user set and controlled, and what was program-run. Both charts for these tools displayed forked range data (displaying the ripples of a “shock”), but had a few differences. Market's chart needed to show more precise edge-case simulation data, versus the primary data that was more closely-correlated to the shock event.

      <h2>The role:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        As the visual designer on a team of engineers focused on risk modeling, I worked with my UX partner and the data scientist to interpret this complex methodology as a tool for understanding how scenarios create, or don't create, risk. My job was to help the user understand what was historical fact versus a simulated future, as well as what actions they controlled. It was also important to translate something very mathematic into data visualization that could be easily understood by those who are more focused on the results.

      <h2>The solve:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        Scenario Analysis is a tool meant both for the economist and the financial advisor. By employing color, different textures, and using area fill shapes instead of only lines to show range, we delivered on data visualization within a tool that was more accessible, offered more assistance to understanding complex methodology, and honored precision.
