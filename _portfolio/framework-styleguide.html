<h2>The case:</h2>
<p>When my team and I began renovating a heavily-used, legacy application, we quickly realized the effort would  require <strong>strong, centralized documentation for designers and developers to reference </strong>in order to replicate like workflows, create visual consistency, and help unify logic.</p>

<h2>The role:</h2>
<p>For this project, I assumed the role of interaction designer. I was in charge of <strong>creating and curating a framework system</strong> for our product that worked within the brand style guide, used and/or contributed to our centralized design system, and also worked for our users; some of whom had been relying on this application long before there was ever branding.</p>

<h2>The solve:</h2>
<p>This document functioned as a <strong>source of truth: a style guide and pattern library</strong> for our work. We started by creating a z-axis layering system to help determine what UI to use for what instance. Over time, we<strong> centralized all our page's actions around a common header and toolbar style.</strong></p>

<p>Not only did we find this crucial for the team as we created more screens and functions, but ultimately helpful for the user as well. The lesson here? <strong>We create trust, familiarity and ease of use within products, large and small, when we are consistent in our decisions.</strong></p>
