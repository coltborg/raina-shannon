      <h2>The case:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        While working on our web application's alert capability, I had to solve for a way to <strong>set, edit and view notification rules in a way suited to the mobile experience</strong>. I also had to <strong>propose content for the push notifications and emails that didn't expose any sensitive data</strong> outside this secure app, while still providing value by being clear what the notification was for.

      <h2>The role:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        As the interaction designer responsible for the framework of the product, I worked with our mobile development team to understand various workflows as they translated to a mobile experience. In this, <strong>I advised the team in a UX capacity, and provided workflow updates for the unique opportunities a mobile environment poses</strong>, such as scrolling and viewing data-dense information.

      <h2>The solve:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        The design system my product worked within was still growing in the mobile element department, which led to my proposing a new order of information for the mobile notification experience.
      </p>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        As opposed to data tables and lists, I suggested an <strong>editable card function with more focused actions</strong> than our desktop app, for ease of user's scrolling and scanning; that could be expanded for more information on what items triggered an alert rule, and review the rule criteria themselves. I also <strong>proposed what parts of the data could be securely surfaced as content</strong> in a potentially public alert, while still being clear as to what the alert is.

      While working on our web application's investment alert capability, I had an opportunity to work with the team in charge of our product's companion  mobile app. The app is in its infancy, and needed a bit of UX direction to ingest a workflow in a mobile-friendly way that wasn't necessarily addressed by our desktop framework.
      In addition, we had to solve for a way to send push notifications or emails that didn't expose any sensitive data outside our secure app, while still providing value by being clear what the notification was for.
