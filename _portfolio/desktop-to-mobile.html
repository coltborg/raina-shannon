      <h2>The case:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        While working on our web application’s alert capability, I had to solve for a way to <strong>set, edit and view notification rules</strong> in a way suited to the mobile experience. I also had to propose content for the <strong>push notifications and emails</strong> that didn’t expose any sensitive data outside this secure app, while still providing value by being clear what the notification was for.

      <h2>The role:</h2>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph">
        As the <strong>interaction designer</strong> responsibile for the framework of the product, I worked with our mobile development team to understand various workflows as they translated to a mobile experience. In this, I advised the team in a <strong>UX</strong> capacity, and provided workflow updates for the unique opportunities a mobile environment poses, such as scrolling and viewing data-dense information.

        The design system my product used was still growing in the mobile element department, and there was no ready-to-use table for mobile data. I directed a new order of information for the mobile notification experience: As opposed to data tables and lists, I outlined an editable card function with <strong>more focused actions</strong> than our desktop app — For the user’s <strong>scrolling and visual scanning ease.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="c-post__paragraph c-post__paragraph--stack">
        These cards could expand for more information on what items triggered an alert rule, and review the rule criteria themselves. I also defined what parts of the cards’ data could be securely surfaced as content in a potentially in-public mobile alert or email (being on a user’s un/locked phone), while still being clear as to what the alert is.
