<p>I was referred to a group of entrepreneurs looking to pitch an idea of theirs to an investment group. The pitch? A mobile-first app that helped folks in roles that didnâ€™t offer 401(k) funds: access one of their own to plan for their futures. </p>

<p>With a short turn-around time, I provided a quick presentation deck on how a mobile user might onboard to such a service, using original visuals and creating a simple logo and color scheme for the pitchdeck.</p>
