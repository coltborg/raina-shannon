# I'm a Graphic Designer, Lettering Artist & Illustrator based in Chicago.<br>-

Though I've lived in Chicago since 2008, I'll always be a Minnesotan at heart. Like most who hail from the Prince State, my accent is thick, my weakness for dairy is apparent, and my belief in kindness is firm. I specialize in custom type, branding, commercial and editorial illustration, book covers and posters â€” but generally I'm happiest working for happy people, doing highly-detailed work and cracking dad jokes.

I spend my days with the wonderful weirdos at [Delicious Design League](#), teach Expressive Type at the Chicago Portfolio School, and travel as much as possible. It's not a bad life.
