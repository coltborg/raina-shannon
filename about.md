# I'm a Graphic Designer & Artist based in Chicago.

I usually say I'm from Texas, but it says "Roswell, NM" on my birth certificate. So who knows where I'm really from.

There is a lot of Scorpio in my astrology chart. I may or may not totally believe in that stuff, but if you do, you practically already know me.

I spend a lot of time learning new hobbies and historical facts that really have nothing to do with my design career â€“ But I can knit you a cool beanie.
