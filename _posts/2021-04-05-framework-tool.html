    <p class="c-post__paragraph">⚠️ Need copy: The Criterion Collection is part of an effort to curate movies considered to be "important classic & contemporary films," & to distribute them to the wider public. Many of these DVD & BluRay releases have unique cover illustrations. Inspired by children's book illustrations, this cover was illustrated simply to convey the seeming frivolity & naiveté of this film.</p>
