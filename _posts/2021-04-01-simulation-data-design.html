      Scenario Analysis is a data methodology that allows a client to visualize hypothetical events. “What if the 2008 recession happened again? Or a global pandemic?” The charts we developed for this tool are meant to demonstrate, provided some economic factors that match a scenario, what could happen based on those “shocks” to the economy.

      We had two tools to provide: the more accessible “Market-Driven Scenario,” and for the more-technical user; a “Macro-Financial Scenario.”
      Both charts for these tools displayed forked range data (showing how wide a shock could ripple out), but had a few differences. Market’s chart needed to show more precise edge-case simulation data, versus the primary data that was more closely-correlated to the shock event.

      While Market’s chart started with the shock, Macro’s chart included pre-existing, real historical data. It made sense to build one on top of the other, but we had to be clear on when we were leaving factual data, and moving into an unknown realm that was determined by a program.

      Scenario Analysis is a tool meant both for the economist and the financial advisor. By employing color, different textures, and using area fill shapes instead of only lines to show range, we delivered on data visualization within a tool that was more accessible, offered more assistance to understanding complex methodology, and honored precision.
