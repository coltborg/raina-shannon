      <p class="c-about__text">I wear many hats when it comes to design, but my favorite role to occupy is that of a <strong>product designer</strong>: I enjoy taking complex data and making it easier to understand; in addition to creating visual accessibility and navigable frameworks.</p>
      <p class="c-about__text"><strong>But when I’m not working</strong>, I can generally be found nerding out over traditional astrology (do tell me your rising sign), playing with different art mediums, pushing myself – and my peers – to get more intersectional, learning to skate, digging into a sci-fi or fantasy novel, or biking about the city.</p>
      <p class="c-about__text">I also host the cutest cat: Pictures upon request.</p>
