      <p class="c-about__text">I usually say I'm from Texas, but it says "Roswell, NM" on my birth certificate. So who knows where I'm really from.</p>

      <p class="c-about__text">There is a lot of Scorpio in my astrology chart. I may or may not totally believe in that stuff, but if you do, you practically already know me.</p>

      <p class="c-about__text">I spend a lot of time learning new hobbies and historical facts that really have nothing to do with my design career â€“ But I can knit you a cool beanie.</p>
